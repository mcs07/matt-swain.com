Cheminformatics formulae for the Homebrew package manager.

Some cheminformatics toolkits are notoriously hard to build from scratch, so I put together these Homebrew formulae to make things easier.

If you don't already have [homebrew](http://brew.sh), installation is simple:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then you can install anything you want using `brew install`.

To get the cheminformatics formulae, you first need to "tap" the repository:

    brew tap mcs07/cheminformatics

Then simply use `brew install`:

    brew install inchi
    brew install opsin
    brew install indigo
    brew install rdkit
    brew install osra
